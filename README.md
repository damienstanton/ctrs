Please note: this repo is now archived. While the prospect of exploring CT in Rust is still interesting, I'd prefer to focus on more practical tools in the ecosystem.

## 👉  [Get Started](https://docs.rs/ctrs)

I intend for each minor version to roughly correspond to one added chapter of documentation. I won't bump the major version
until I get to the second Milewski course, and later the third, etc.

Note: This crate is more like a journal or notebook than a functional library; Import at your own discretion.
