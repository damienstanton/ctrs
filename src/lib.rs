//! ## or, an exploration of category theory for _systems programmers_
//!
//! ![a category](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Category_SVG.svg)
//!
//! What follows in this library is derived from _Category Theory for Programmers_, a long-running blog series by
//! [Bartosz Milewki](https://twitter.com/BartoszMilewski). A nice "book" created from original blog posts can be found [here](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf).
//!
//! ### Goals
//!
//! My intention is simply to share my learning experience with category theory by using the built-in documentation and
//! testing faculties that Rust provides. I will also conduct screen casts to explore each implementation so that I can
//! make sure that what I commit to the crate is logical. I hope that by doing this, others can apply this knowledge to
//! what they do at `$WORK` in C++, Go, Java, etc.

//! ### Non-code challenge questions:
//!
//! Chapter 1
//!
//! _Is the world-wide web a category in any sense? Are links morphisms?_
//!
//! > I would say yes. We know that web pages have something akin to an identity morphism: its URI/URL. And links between pages
//! may be composable (a link from site A to B can, through the redirect protocol, map to a third side C).
//!
//! _Is Facebook a category, with people as objects and friendships as morphisms?_
//!
//! > Not really, because social relationships cannot always compose. Friend C, friend of B, is not necessarily friend of A.
//!
//! _When is a directed graph a category?_
//!
//! > A DAG would classify as a category when a graph _G_ has vertices _V_ and edges _E_ such that:
//! > - all paths in the graph can be concatenated
//! > - each V has an E that loops back to itself (so that it satisfies identity)

/// Identity is a unit under composition.
///
/// # Overview
/// We describe a function over a generic type `T` that simply returns its parameterized value, unchanged. This might
/// seem a little odd.
///
/// But as Bartosz describes, the motivation for understanding identity is to enable a higher order of composition:
/// > You might be asking yourself the question: Why would anyone bother
/// > with the identity function â€” a function that does nothing? Then again,
/// > why do we bother with the number zero? Zero is a symbol for nothing.
/// > Ancient Romans had a number system without a zero and they were
/// > able to build excellent roads and aqueducts, some of which survive to
/// > this day.
/// > Neutral values like zero or id are extremely useful when working
/// >
/// > with symbolic variables. Thatâ€™s why Romans were not very good at algebra, whereas the Arabs and the Persians, who were familiar with the
/// > concept of zero, were. So the identity function becomes very handy as
/// > an argument to, or a return from, a higher-order function. Higher order
/// > functions are what make symbolic manipulation of functions possible.
/// > They are the algebra of functions.
/// >
/// > To summarize: A category consists of objects and arrows (mor phisms). Arrows can be composed, and the composition is associative.
/// >
/// > Every object has an identity arrow that serves as a unit under composition.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use ctrs::id;
///
/// let x = 1;
/// assert_eq!(id(1), 1);
///
/// let y = "OK";
/// assert_eq!(id(y), "OK");
/// ```
pub fn id<T>(x: T) -> T {
    x
}

/// Composition is the heart of categorical computation.
///
/// # Overview
/// Our definition of composition may appear confusing at first, but let's break it down. We start by defining generic
/// types for our two input functions. These are`F` and `G`, respectively. These have a `'static`lifetime because we
/// have to ensure that the borrow checker does not let these types out of scope before computation has finished. Next,
/// we have types `Fv` and `Gv`, which represent the return types for each of the functions F and G. Finally, we have
/// our output type `V`, which is the result we want. We pass thefunctions G and F as parameters `g` and `f`.
///
/// Still with me?
///
/// Next, the return value is a `Box` of the generic `Fn` type which returnsour desired output type `V`. We have to box
/// the return value because we donot know how much size it could occupy on the stack (and thus allocate tothe heap).
/// Finally, we implement trait bounds on F and G, specifying howthe chain should compose: F takes an Fv to a Gv, and
/// then G takes a Gv toV. In the body of the function, we returned a _moved_ value of g applied tof of x, because
/// otherwise the value go out of scope (and die) at the end ofthe function.
///
/// Phew! ðŸ˜…
///
/// Let's now see how this looks in practice using an example.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use ctrs::{id, compose};
///
/// // Let's first define a trivial incrementer function.
/// fn inc(x: i32) -> i32 {
///   x + 1
/// }
///
/// // and cover our bases by confirming inc works as expected.
/// let x = 1;
/// assert_eq!(inc(x), 2);
///
/// // Since we are composing functions on a given value, the syntax is
/// // compose(A, B)(V). Knowing this, our passing test looks like:
/// assert_eq!(compose(id, inc)(1), 2);
/// ```
///
/// We can extend this idea! Let's take the situation where we've also defined an admittedly contrived `double`
/// function, and want to compose its behavior with our existing incrementer. Mathematicians sometimes call the
/// composition operator one might find in Haskell _after_, and understanding the way in which the function associates
/// is indeed _g after f_.
/// ```
/// # use ctrs::{id, compose};
/// # fn inc(x: i32) -> i32 {
/// #   x + 1
/// # }
/// fn double(x: i32) -> i32 {
///    x * 2
/// }
///
/// let x = 1;
/// assert_eq!(compose(inc, double)(1), 4);
/// ```
pub fn compose<F: 'static, G: 'static, Fv, Gv, V>(f: F, g: G) -> Box<Fn(Fv) -> V>
where
    F: Fn(Fv) -> Gv,
    G: Fn(Gv) -> V,
